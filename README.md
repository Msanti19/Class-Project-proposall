# my project originally was going to be pogue timer, but decided to make a python drawing instead in python turtle. My project draws a bird with some small background scenery elements to deliver a nice scene in TurtleDraw.
# If i had more time i would probably have put my actual drawing lines in a text file as it would make it a bit easier and add more elements to the background or make the actual screen larger to allow for more background elements.
